# Chess With Friends
Anthony Stem, Tai Kitazato, Aiden Mccormack, Heshi Muntiu

## A Brief Description
We are working to make a functional chess game where you and your friends can compete against each other online. Currently, we have a fully functioning chess board that follows all the rules (excluding en passant)

## Getting started
To use our chess board, just download the repository and run the main.py. From there, you can click on the multiplayer option and you can play. For now, our game can only be done using one computer, but we are working on implementing multiplayer between multiple computers.
